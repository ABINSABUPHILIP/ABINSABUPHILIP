âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a CSE enthusiast with a love for hacking and experimenting with code. From coding late into the night to solve algorithmic puzzles to building quirky, yet functional, software applications just for fun, my passion for computer science extends well beyond the classroom. One of my most memorable coding adventures involved [share a brief anecdote or project]. It's amazing how a simple line of code can lead to exciting discoveries and endless possibilities in the world of technology! ðŸš€


ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on various projects that involve my above interests.
